  this demo is based on the at-start board, in this demo, provides a description of how to use op1 peripheral in
  follower mode and vp channel switched by tmr1 cc6.
  default selection of the non inverting input: dac1 output(dac1 configured to generate a pwm voltage waveform);
  secondary selection of the non inverting input is inp0(pa1),user need give a voltage waveform.
  op1 output is pa2.
  note: operational amplifier must be calibrated before use.
