  this demo is based on the at-start board, in this demo, provides a description 
  of how to use op2 peripheral in programmable gain amplifier mode and op2 calibration
  use adc1 channel20. user need to generate a voltage waveform to the op2 input(pa7)
  and op2 output voltage is continuously converted by adc1 channel20.
  note:input voltage must be less than 3.3v/4.
       operational amplifier must be calibrated before use.
